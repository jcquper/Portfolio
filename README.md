Hello I'm Jacqueline, I've never made a resume much less even knew how to make a portfolio so sorry if some information is redundant I just feel underqualified in regards to filling in the information and just looked at a lot of references online. I also dont have any professional images so just used the most appropriate nonselfie picture I had. I ran into a lot of troube while coding and realized I do need to work a lot of style because the goal of the image gallery was to have an image as the background of the text featured which is really frustrating not have achieved.  I made a few comments since my feedback last week asked me to but I'm still not sure what to even write in those sections and kept it minimal.
I was also asked to elaborate more in my readme and provide links and screenshots but I dont know how to add that here/add pictures saved to my computer to an html file.
