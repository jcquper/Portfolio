Hello I'm Jacqueline, this is my second draft of my portfolio and I hope it is much better than the original I had submitted to bootcamp spot. I am running late on submitting the portfolio because I believed it was due October 8th. I am going to be changing the lay out of the website so it is more attention grabbing to a potential employer, will be taking more professional photographs, add more color to the site, and include a few of my own coding projects as links for people viewing my portfolio can see what I am capable of creating. I have also updated my readme and will add more comments in html so that there is more explanation in each step I take and why I chose to make those changes. I hope that is a much more professional approach as usually code changes are looked over by other team members. Please let me know any suggestions in my comments I feel a bit lost on projects like this.
