I thought I updated this I guess not? This is the 3rd draft of my Portfolio (that I'm turning in atleast). I added a lot of new styling ideas I have learned from our recent projeccts and I added some javascript to make my gallery a little bit more interesting. I used materialize's framework to get a better grid system and boost my style points. I also added my own artwork I created on figma as a placeholder for a logo next to my name. I feel like this version is the best portfolio I've had so far so I would appreciate any comments you have on how I can make it stronger. I will be adding more pictures soon!
