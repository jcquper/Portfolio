Hi this is portfolio update number 3 today I went for a complete change and wanted to incorporate more of my own personal style. I really enjoy more minimal websites and a cooler toned neutral color palette. I also wanted to make better use of the space available and used Materialize's framework so that I can organize my grids better + earn huge style points. This website is heavy on html and css for all the links and images but I added an assets folder with imgs saved so I no longer have to worry about loading. I also designed a logo for myself based off of my passion for taxidermy. Hopefully you enjoy my portfolio I feel like it can come off kind of pretentious when something is too cold and minimal so I used a little bit more informal language throughout the site and in my READme to hopefully show more duality? LOL still have a lot to learn about representing myself to the best of my potential to a employer :/
